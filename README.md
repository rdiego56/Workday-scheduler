For this assignment, I generated a workday schedule for employees.

* When prompted to the page you are brought up with the calendar where the date is given at the top.

* Through the page you are then presented with timeblocks.

* The time blocks are colored as well depending on if it's past, present, or future.

* When clicking on the time block, you are able to enter an event to your liking.

* You are then able to click the save button when done, which it should be saved to the console log. Then when the page is refreshed the event should stay.
