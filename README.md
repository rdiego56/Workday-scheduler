# Workday-scheduler

For this assignment I generated a workday schedular for employees.

* When prompted to the page you are brought up with the calender where the date is given at the top.

* Through the page you are then presented with timeblocks.

* The timeblocks are colored as well depending if its past, present or future.

* When clicking on the timeblock, you are able to enter an event to your liking.

* You are then able to click the save button when done, which it should be saved to console log. Then when the page is refreshed the event should stay.
